In my small university dorm room I completed pt_src3.s right before I was about to start my university studies at Chalmers.

pt_src3.s was the amalgam of all the best ideas I had seen for Paula emulators for Atari STE.

At the time of the release I felt the Atari STE was definitely fading away in favour of the PC. I thought pt_src3.s was a good paula emulator across several metrics but because of the disappearance of the Atari scene it would never see. I uploaded the pt_src3.s to ftp.sunet.se and ftp.funet.fi and turned off my Atari STE.

## Summer 2000, Göteborg

I was now working as a junior software engineer for a company doing map engine and other consultancy work. I had forgotten about my Atari STE and pt_src3.s.

I was therefore very surprised when I was contacted over email by [Leonard](https://demozoo.org/sceners/2527/) asking my about pt_src3.s and if I could do something about the excessive memory usage of it for a demo he was creating.

We exchanged a few emails back and forth but basically came to the conclusion that speed of pt_src3.s came from lots of self-generated code and that making it 25kHz would be rather difficult and not reclaim that much memory.

He had some ideas on how to address the problem and I didn't hear much more.

I was later blown away about what he used it for when I saw [STNICCC 2000 Demo](https://demozoo.org/productions/59549/)([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqVJWFNpTqA&t=20s)).

A life-time achievment unlocked for me although I consider the Paula emulator a very small part of that demo.
