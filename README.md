In my small university dorm room I completed pt_src3.s right before I was about to start my university studies at Chalmers.

pt_src3.s was the amalgam of all the best ideas I had seen for Paula emulators for Atari STE.

At the time of the release I felt the Atari STE was definitely fading away in favour of the PC. I thought pt_src3.s was a good paula emulator across several metrics but because of the disappearance of the Atari scene it would never see. I uploaded the pt_src3.s to ftp.sunet.se and ftp.funet.fi and turned off my Atari STE.
